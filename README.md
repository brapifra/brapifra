## Hi there 👋

#### 🔭 I’m currently working at Tray.io
A super cool company that it's [looking for](https://tray.io/careers#careers) someone like you.

#### 🌱 I’m currently learning Vim
Although I'm still using vscode most of the time 🤫

#### 👯 I like getting my hands dirty
That's why I contribute to several projects like [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest), [apollo](https://github.com/apollographql) and [testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library).

#### 😄 I make things that people seem to like
For example, my extension [vscode-phpserver](https://github.com/brapifra/vscode-phpserver) has over 300K downloads!

#### 💬 Ask me about orienteering, testing or startups
Or whatever you can think of. I like learning new things.

#### 🐮 Fun fact: I know how to milk a cow and drive a tractor
And I won't hesitate to use those skills!
